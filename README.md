jekyll-page-list-plugin
=======================

List pages easily and in different ways with Jekyll

Usage
------------

```{% toc /foo/bar,false,Title %}```


I just split the param on ','.  Maybe there is a better way.

* param1 = directory to list
* param2 = list sub files?
* param3 = Title of div

The above would insert a page list located in your directory "pages/foo/bar", it would not list pages in sub directories, and the table of contents would have a title "Title"

TODO
-----

* Style better
* Handle Params better
